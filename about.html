<h1>About</h1>

<h3>This project is based on the concept of new planets that we have not discovered. Perhaps there are planets
smaller than we can imagine and they can fit in our very hands. When I was a child, I would imagine small civilizations
hidden in the blades of grass in my front yard that would be living comepletely independent of us and before our very eyes.
What if we all had the power to protect and hold an entire world in our hands? Alternatively, what if we had the power to hold
Earth in the palm of our hands? Would we protect it? Or take adantage? As I wrestle with this idea, it takes me back to my
childhood and how everything seemed so harmless and childish. But with age we begin to see how frivoulous the world is with what we have.
I hope this project can challenge viewers and their perspectives on how we need to take further into account what we have in our hands, and what we can do to protect it.

 This project utilizes GLTF Loader and OBJ Loader.
